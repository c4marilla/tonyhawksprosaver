## 🛹 *"Or did I mean to say savior?"*

The aim of this project is having the presence of a simple digital archive that lets you download actual 100% save files for the most appreciated Tony Hawk games since most of them either seem to be gone from the old Internet or the available links themselves are broken and unreachable. 




## 🔧 Installation

Just drag and drop the provided file(s) onto the required folder to skip your favorite game's story mode/gap hunting and start digging for clips, transfers or simply enjoy a fully unlocked game and limitless arcade experience without having the need to invest your own (and probably) limited time into these arduous tasks. When in doubt, simply read the tutorial each packaged download's README has.

## ❗Disclaimer

My save files don't contain BBcas or any external modifications. In case they do and I haven't noticed since anybody can make mistakes, make sure to let me know and I'll correct it right away.

The THAW CAS has been tested both offline and online and the manual/balance tests indicate no tampering since the score values are the usual ones.
